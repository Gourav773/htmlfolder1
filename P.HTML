    <h2>Bat-and-ball games </h2>
    <p><b>Bat-and-ball games</b> (or safe haven games[1]) are field games played by two opposing teams. Action starts when the defending team throws a ball  at a dedicated player of the attacking team, who tries to hit it with a bat and run between various safe areas in the field to score runs (points). The defending team can use the ball in various ways against the attacking team's players to force them off the field when they are not in safe zones, and thus prevent them from further <del>scoring</del>.[2][3] The best known modern bat-and-ball games are cricket and baseball, with common roots in the h<sub>2</sub>O 18th-century games played in England.</p>
